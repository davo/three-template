## 164 → r165

- The signature of `WebGLRenderer.copyTextureToTexture()` and `WebGLRenderer.copyTextureToTexture3D()` has changed. It is now `copyTextureToTexture( srcTexture, dstTexture, srcRegion = null, dstPosition = null, level = 0 )`. For more information, check out the examples [webgl_materials_texture_partialupdate](https://threejs.org/examples/webgl_materials_texture_partialupdate) and [webgl2_materials_texture3d_partialupdate](https://threejs.org/examples/webgl2_materials_texture3d_partialupdate).
- The signature of `WebGLRenderer.copyFramebufferToTexture()` has changed. It is now `copyFramebufferToTexture( texture, position = null, level = 0 )`. For more information, check out the example [webgl_framebuffer_texture](https://threejs.org/examples/webgl_framebuffer_texture).

## 163 → r164

- `LWOLoader` uses a new conversion from left to right-handed coordinate system now. That means imported LWO assets will be oriented differently than before. Check out [#28029](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/pull/28029) to see how the official example was updated to restore the previous look.
- The async parse method of `USDZLoader` has been renamed to `parseAsync()`. The new `parse()` method can be used with classic callbacks.
- The shader chunk `lightmap_fragment` has been removed. If your custom material relies on it, you have to inline the GLSL code into your shader.
- The legacy `WebGLNodeBuilder` class has been removed which enabled a limited node material usage with `WebGLRenderer`. The node material can only be used with `WebGPURenderer` now.

## 162 → r163

- `WebGLRenderer` no longer supports WebGL 1.
- The `stencil` context attribute of `WebGLRenderer` is now `false` by default for performance reasons. If you use stencil related logic in your app, you have to enable `stencil` explicitly now. The corresponding `stencil` property of `WebGPURenderer` is now `false` by default as well.
- The `height` parameter of `TextGeometry` has been renamed to `depth`.
- To attenuate `Scene.environment`, use the new property `Scene.environmentIntensity`. The `envMapIntensity` property of `MeshStandardMaterial` and `MeshPhysicalMaterial` now attenuate only the material's `envMap`.

## r161 → r162

- `WebGLMultipleRenderTargets` has been removed. Use the new `count` property of the render target classes for MRT usage.
- Hand-Tracking is not requested as an optional feature by default anymore. You have to do this manually on app level now like demonstrated in the related [examples](https://threejs.org/examples/?q=handinput).
- The API of `InteractiveGroup` has been changed. You have to use the new methods `listenToXRControllerEvents()` and `listenToPointerEvents()` to register the internal event listeners.
- When using an instance of `HTMLImageElement` for a texture, the renderer uses now `naturalWidth` and `naturalHeight` instead of `width` and `height` for computing the image dimensions. This enables simplifications on app level if the images are part of the DOM and resized with CSS.

## r160 → r161

- The build files `build/three.js` and `build/three.min.js` have been removed. Please use ES Modules or alternatives: https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/en/introduction/Installation
- `WebGLRenderer` now specifies precision qualifiers for all GLSL sampler types.
- `GroundProjectedSkybox` has been replaced with `GroundedSkybox`.
- When using equirectangular environment maps, `WebGLRenderer` automatically converts to the cube map format with a larger texture size now. This avoids undersampling resulting in blurry output but it requires more memory. If you encounter performance issues, decrease the resolution of your equirectangular environment map.

## r159 → r160

- `HBAOPass` has been replaced with `GTAOPass`.
- `Triangle.getBarycoord()` and `Triangle.getInterpolation()` now return `null` if the triangle is degenerate. (For degenerate triangles, the `target` parameter is set to the zero-vector).

## 157 → 158

- `Quaternion`s are now expected to be normalized.
- The material property `bumpScale` is now invariant to the scale of texture coordinates. That means bump maps look now the same regardless of the texture UV scale in world space. If you are using bump mapping, you likely have to update the `bumpScale` value to achieve a similar look like before. More details in https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/pull/26899.

## 156 → 157

- `AmbientLightProbe` and `HemisphereLightProbe` have been removed. Use `AmbientLight` or `HemisphereLight`, instead.
- The GLSL struct `GeometricContext` has been removed from the GLSL code base to make materials more compatible with Adreno mobile GPUs. When you patch shaders via `onBeforeCompile()` or reuse shader chunks with custom materials, you potentially have to remove references to `GeometricContext` similar to https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/pull/26805.
- `AnimationUtils.arraySlice()` has been removed. Internal code uses the native `TypedArray.slice()` method instead.

## 155 → 156

- The constructor of `OutputPass` has no parameters anymore. Color space and tone mapping settings are now extracted from the renderer.

## 153 → 154

- The shader chunk `encodings_fragment` has been renamed to `colorspace_fragment`.

_For more information, please see the [Updates to Color Management in three.js r152](https://discourse.threejs.org/t/updates-to-color-management-in-three-js-r152/50791) guide._

## 150 → 151

- `Float16BufferAttribute` now automatically converts values to and from half float in its setters/getters.
- `SkinnedMesh.boneTransform()` has been renamed to `applyBoneTransform()`.
- `InstancedMesh.frustumCulled` is now `true` by default since `InstancedMesh` now supports bounding volume computations. If you update the transformation of your instances, make sure to call `computeBoundingSphere()` to recompute the bounding sphere which is required for correct view frustum culling and ray casting. 
- `MapControls` is now located in its own module file `three/addons/controls/MapControls.js`.

- The editor now uses the physically correct lighting mode (`WebGLRenderer.useLegacyLights = false`).
- `Points` now supports texture coordinates. When a `uv` attribute is present in the geometry, the shader will use it to sample the color or alpha value from `map` or `alphaMap` for a single point. Without a `uv` attribute, point clouds are rendered as before. 
- `ShaderMaterial.forceSinglePass` is now `true` by default.
- `aoMap` and `lightMap` no longer use `uv2`. Set `material.lightMap.channel` to `0` for `uv` and `1` for `uv2`. Consequently, the `uv2_*` shader chunks have been removed.

## 149 → 150

- The build files `build/three.js` and `build/three.min.js` are deprecated with r150+, and will be removed with r160. Please use ES Modules or alternatives: https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/en/introduction/Installation

## 147 → 148

- The `examples/js` directory has been removed. Addons like `GLTFLoader` or `OrbitControls` are now only available as ES6 modules in the `examples/jsm` directory. Certain library files from `examples/js/libs` are moved to `examples/jsm/libs`. Users of ammo.js, Draco and Basis have to update their import paths (e.g. from `/examples/js/libs/draco/` to `/examples/jsm/libs/draco/`). Also check out the [Installation](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/en/introduction/Installation) guide in the documentation if you are using ES6 modules for the first time.
- The default `radial` values of `CircleGeometry`, `RingGeometry`, `CylinderGeometry`, `ConeGeometry` and `TorusGeometry` have been increased.

## 146 → 147

- The `decay` property of `PointLight` and `SpotLight` has now a physically correct default value (`2`). This change will affect all scenes using point and spot lights with no defined `decay`. Set the property back to `1` if you want to restore the previous behavior.
- `BufferAttribute.onUploadCallback()` is now executed every time buffer data are transferred to the GPU.
- Support for the `KHR_materials_pbrSpecularGlossiness` extensions has been removed from `GLTFLoader` and `GLTFExporter`. Older glTF assets should be losslessly [converted from spec/gloss to metal/rough](https://www.donmccurdy.com/2022/11/28/converting-gltf-pbr-materials-from-specgloss-to-metalrough/).
