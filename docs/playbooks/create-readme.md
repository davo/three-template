# üìù README Creation Playbook

---

## Overview

This playbook outlines a structured, repeatable process for creating high-quality `README.md` files for software repositories. It ensures clarity, relevance, usability, and professionalism for both new and experienced developers. The outcome is a README that provides clear context, smooth onboarding, and effortless project comprehension.

## README Development Process

1. **Establish the Primary Purpose**
   - Describe what the project does in a single sentence.
   - Ensure this is the first line users see.

2. **Define the Audience**
   - Is this README for contributors? End users? Internal teams?
   - Tailor tone and depth accordingly.

3. **Include a Table of Contents (if README is long)**
   - Enables fast navigation.
   - Use anchor links for each section.

4. **Add Quick Start Instructions**
   - Show how to install, build, and run the project.
   - Use copy-pasteable shell commands.
   - Support both `npm` and `yarn` where relevant.

5. **Explain Project Structure (if non-trivial)**
   - Briefly describe major directories and files.
   - Use a code block for clarity.

6. **Link to Further Documentation**
   - Reference deeper docs, wikis, or relevant external guides.
   - Use absolute URLs when linking across repositories.

7. **Note Compatibility and Requirements**
   - Include supported Node.js/Angular/React/etc. versions.
   - Mention critical dependencies and breaking changes.

8. **Add Visual Aids**
   - Screenshots, architecture diagrams, or badges (status, CI, coverage).
   - Place visuals near the top for impact.

9. **Include Contribution Guidelines**
   - Link to CONTRIBUTING.md or add a minimal section.
   - Clarify whether issues and PRs are welcome.

10. **Add License Information**
   - Specify license type clearly (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0).
   - Link to the full LICENSE file.

11. **Attribute README Authors (Subtly)**
   - Mention contributors and maintainers.
   - _Based on [Devin](https://app.devin.ai) Playbook._

## Tips and Best Practices

- Start with a **problem statement** or use case if the purpose isn‚Äôt obvious.
- Assume the reader has limited context‚Äîdefine acronyms.
- Show examples, especially for APIs or CLI tools.
- Use badges judiciously‚ÄîCI status, version, and license are usually enough.
- Validate all Markdown renders correctly on GitHub or GitLab.
- Treat the README as a product homepage: make it welcoming.
- Use `npm run` or `yarn` scripts in examples when available.
- Update the README with every major code or tooling change.
- Add version numbers to install commands if breaking changes exist.
- Use inline comments in code blocks to explain unusual commands.

## Prohibited Practices

‚ùå Don‚Äôt paste lengthy changelogs ‚Äî use CHANGELOG.md
‚ùå Avoid ambiguous phrasing (e.g., ‚Äújust install and run it‚Äù)
‚ùå Don‚Äôt leave outdated install instructions or hardcoded versions
‚ùå Don‚Äôt copy-paste dependency trees unless necessary
‚ùå Avoid unnecessary badges or verbose section titles
‚ùå Don‚Äôt skip testing example commands ‚Äî verify they work
‚ùå Never assume users will read the source code to understand the project
