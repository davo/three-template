## 1. Objective

*A clear, concise, one-sentence statement describing the primary goal of this task. What is the single most important outcome?*

**Example**: To refactor the authentication module to use JWT instead of session cookies.

## 2. Problem Statement & Rationale

*A brief explanation of the problem this task solves or the opportunity it addresses. Why is this task necessary now? What is the context?*

**Example**: The current session-based authentication system does not scale well across our microservices architecture and prevents us from offering stateless API access to third-party developers. Moving to JWT will solve these issues.

## 3. Scope & Deliverables

*A clear definition of what is included and, just as importantly, what is **not** included in this task. List the specific artifacts that will be produced.*

- **In Scope**: 
  - [ ] Implementing JWT generation and validation.
  - [ ] Updating the user login and logout endpoints.
  - [ ] Adding middleware to protect authenticated routes.
- **Out of Scope**:
  - [ ] Refresh token implementation.
  - [ ] Two-factor authentication.
- **Deliverables**:
  - [ ] A new `jwt_service.py` module.
  - [ ] Updated `auth_controller.py`.
  - [ ] Unit tests for the new JWT service.

## 4. Implementation Plan / Action Items

*A step-by-step checklist of the actions required to complete the task. This should be detailed enough for someone else to understand the workflow.*

- [ ] **Phase 1: Backend Logic**
  - [ ] Add `PyJWT` to the project dependencies.
  - [ ] Create the core `generate_token` and `decode_token` functions.
  - [ ] Implement the `/login` endpoint to return a JWT.
- [ ] **Phase 2: Frontend Integration**
  - [ ] Update the login form to store the JWT in local storage.
  - [ ] Create an Axios interceptor to add the `Authorization` header to requests.
- [ ] **Phase 3: Testing & Validation**
  - [ ] Write unit tests for token generation and validation edge cases.
  - [ ] Perform end-to-end manual testing of the login/logout flow.

## 5. Success & Acceptance Criteria

*A set of measurable, verifiable conditions that must be met for the task to be considered complete. How do we know we are done and have succeeded?*

- [ ] Users can successfully log in and receive a valid JWT.
- [ ] Protected endpoints return a 401 Unauthorized error without a valid JWT.
- [ ] All new code is covered by unit tests with at least 90% coverage.
- [ ] The implementation is documented in the `docs/architecture/authentication.md` file.

## 6. Risks & Mitigation

*Identify potential risks and a plan to mitigate them.*

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Plan |
|---|---|---|---|
| Secret key exposure | Low | High | Store the JWT secret in an environment variable, loaded via a secure vault. Do not hardcode it. |
| Replay attacks | Medium | Medium | Keep token expiration times short (e.g., 15 minutes) and implement a token blocklist for logout. |

## 7. Files to Modify

*A specific list of files that are expected to be created, modified, or deleted during this task. This helps in code review and understanding the task's footprint.*

- **Created**:
  - `src/services/jwt_service.py`
  - `tests/test_jwt_service.py`
- **Modified**:
  - `src/controllers/auth_controller.py`
  - `pyproject.toml`
  - `docs/architecture/authentication.md`
- **Deleted**:
  - `src/services/session_manager.py`
