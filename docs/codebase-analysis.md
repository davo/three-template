# Codebase Analysis Report

## 1. Project Overview

This project is a Three.js boilerplate designed to provide a modern starting point for WebGL applications. It uses a custom `esbuild` setup for development and production builds.

## 2. Tech Stack

-   **Core Library:** `three`
-   **Physics:** `cannon-es`
-   **Build Tool:** Custom `esbuild.js` script
-   **Package Manager:** `yarn`
-   **Language:** JavaScript (ESM)
-   **Linting:** `eslint`
-   **Formatting:** `prettier` (inferred from `eslint-config-prettier`)
-   **Development Server:** `browser-sync`

## 3. Project Structure

-   `public/`: Contains the main `index.html` and static assets.
-   `src/`: Contains the application's JavaScript source code.
    -   `index.js`: The main entry point of the application.
    -   `scene/`: Contains scene-related components like lights and objects.
    -   `utils/`: Contains utility classes and functions, including a `WebGLApp` helper.
-   `esbuild.js`: Custom build script for development and production.
-   `package.json`: Defines project dependencies and scripts.

## 4. Build Process

-   **Development:** The `yarn start` command runs the `esbuild.js` script in development mode. This script uses `esbuild` to bundle the application, starts a `browser-sync` server for live reloading, and opens the browser.
-   **Production:** The `yarn build` command runs the `esbuild.js` script in production mode. This bundles, minifies, and hashes the output file, and injects the hashed filename into the `index.html`.

## 5. Key Dependencies

-   **`three`**: The core 3D rendering library.
-   **`cannon-es`**: A physics engine forked from `cannon.js`.
-   **`postprocessing`**: A library for applying post-processing effects to the scene.
-   **`lil-gui`**: A lightweight GUI for debugging.
-   **`esbuild`**: The JavaScript bundler.
-   **`browser-sync`**: The development server.
-   **`eslint`**: The linter.

## 6. Refactoring Plan

The current setup, while functional, relies on a custom build script and a mix of tools that can be streamlined. The refactoring plan outlined in `GEMINI.md` aims to modernize the toolchain by:

1.  **Replacing `esbuild.js` and `yarn` with Vite and pnpm:** This will simplify the build process and improve performance.
2.  **Migrating from ESLint/Prettier to Biome:** This will unify linting and formatting under a single, faster tool.
3.  **Converting the codebase to TypeScript:** This will improve code quality and maintainability.
4.  **Integrating Vitest for testing:** This will provide a solid foundation for unit testing.
5.  **Upgrading all dependencies:** This will ensure the project is up-to-date with the latest features and security patches.

This analysis confirms that the project is a good candidate for the proposed refactoring. The existing structure is modular enough to facilitate a phased migration.

- `eslint`: `^9.15.0` → `^9.32.0`
- `eslint-config-prettier`: `^9.1.0` → `^10.1.8`
- `image-promise`: `^7.0.1` → `^8.0.0`
- `lil-gui`: `^0.19.2` → `^0.20.0`
- `ora`: `^8.1.1` → `^8.2.0`
- `p-map`: `^7.0.1` → `^7.0.3`
- `postprocessing`: `^6.36.0` → `^6.37.6`

## 8. Three.js Migration Strategy

As per the official Three.js migration guide, dependency updates should be handled incrementally. The recommendation is to "update the library in increments of 10" to manage API changes and deprecation warnings effectively. This strategy will be adopted in Phase 5 when upgrading the `three` dependency.
